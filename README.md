# WIP 
Work-in-progress, since I have to extract it from my previous projects.
I shall also refactor code, so it's NIY for now.

# Usage
1. `npm install --save another-react-gallery`
2. Prepare CSS styles, which set height attribute for gallery.
2. Import it and use it.

# another-react-gallery 
Simple implementation of galery, which can be used on a website.
